# Deploy vehicle classifier using flask on heroku

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7%2B-green.svg)]()


> This is a web application that has been developed using the fastai library and is deployed on heroku. The application takes thousands of images from the VMMRdb dataset and classifies to the make and model level of vehicles between 1990 and 2012. There are just under 400 different categories of vehicles and the model sports a 91% accuracy level trained on a GTX 1060i GPU.

## Getting started

- Fork and clone this repo on to your system


## Customization

### Put your model inside path/models folder

- Place your trained `.pth` file under path/models/ directory.

### Change the class and path name

- Open "app.py" and search for a variable called classes and change that with your own classes

- If your path name is different that "stage-2.pth", then change the learn.load("with_your_file_name.pth") in "app.py"




### UI Change

Modify files in `templates` and `static` directory.

`index.html` for the UI and `main.js` for all the behaviors
